bHe said I\xe2\x80\x99ll abolish the 2nd Amendmen Wrong. He said I\xe2\x80\x99ll let a flood of refugees into our untry without any screening. Also wrong.

bTrumps Muslim ban is wrong, dangerous, and in this instance, nonsensical. The terrorist in Orlando was born in Queens\xe2\x80\x94just like Donald.

bThe terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. \n\nAn attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.

bInflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, and its dangerous.

bBackground checks and an assault weapons ban might not stop every attack\xe2\x80\x94but theyll stop some, and save lives. We need to fight for them.

bIn Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.

bIf the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.
